# Numpad

First, I am starting with a numpad that has most of the features I want

## Features

* Single push button rotary encoder
* Regular numpad with 3 top keys
* Hot swap sockets
* North facing key mounts
* Addressable reverse mount RGB keys
* Integrated plate mount

Essentially, the full size design without the usb hub.
